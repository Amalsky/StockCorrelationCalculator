This program is designed to calculate the correlation between two stocks based on daily closing prices from Yahoo Finance. The user is required to input the stock data into a CSV file, which can be downloaded from Yahoo Finance. The CSV file should contain the daily closing prices for each stock.

The program includes a function that accepts two inputs: the filename of the CSV file, and the opening price of the stock. The function will then read the data from the CSV file, perform the necessary calculations to determine the correlation between the two stocks, and return the results to the user.

The user is expected to input the daily closing prices of both stocks into the CSV file in a specific format, with each row representing a single day of trading and the columns containing the date and closing price of each stock. The program will use this data to calculate the correlation between the two stocks and provide a concise analysis of their relationship.
