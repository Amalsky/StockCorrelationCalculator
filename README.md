# StockCorrelationCalculator
This program is designed to calculate the correlation between two stocks based on data from Yahoo Finance. The user is required to input the stock data into a CSV file, which can be downloaded from Yahoo Finance. The program includes a function that accepts two inputs: the filename of the CSV file, and the opening price of the stock.
